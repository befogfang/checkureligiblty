 #🇮🇳 Government Job Roles Explorer
  
  A modern, responsive web application built with React and Tailwind CSS to showcase over 50 major government job roles in India, providing detailed descriptions and essential statistics in an easy-to-digest card format.
  
  ✨ Features
  
  This application focuses on delivering a seamless and informative user experience with the following key features:
  
  Vertical Card Layout: Job roles are displayed in clean, vertical, and responsive cards, optimized for mobile and desktop viewing.
  
  Click-to-Expand Descriptions: The detailed, first-person job descriptions are initially truncated to two lines for brevity. Users can click anywhere on the card to instantly expand and view the full description.

Recruiting Body Highlighting: Cards use color-coding to quickly identify the primary recruiting body (UPSC, SSC, IBPS, RRB, etc.).

Email Subscription (Formspree Integration): Includes a functional subscription form that uses Formspree (a free Form-as-a-Service solution) to collect user emails for future project updates without needing a dedicated backend server.

Clear Data Presentation: Essential statistics like Starting Pay, Group Grade, and Max Age Limit are clearly displayed.
